    "[W] Giapettoâ€™s Woodcarving, Inc., manufactures two types of wooden toys: soldiers and trains. A soldier sells for 27 and uses 10 worth of raw materials. Each soldier that is manufactured increases Giapettoâ€™s variable labor and overhead costs by 14. A train sells for 21 and uses 9 worth of raw materials. Each train build increases Giapettoâ€™s variable labor and overhead costs by 10. The manufacture of wooden soldiers and trains requires two types of skilled labor: carpentry and finishing. A soldier requires 2 hours of finishing labor and 1 hour of carpentry labor. A train requires 1 hour of finishing and 1 hour of carpentry labor. Each week, Giapetto can obtain all the needed raw material but only 100 finishing hours and 80 carpentry hours. Demand for trains is unlimited, but at most 40 soldiers are bought each week. Giapetto wants to maximize weekly profit (revenues - costs).\n"
