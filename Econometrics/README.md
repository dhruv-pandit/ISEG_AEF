## Folders
- The folders are broken down into Microeconometrics and Macroeconometrics. While most of the code/implementation might look similar, the nature of the data and the inference being conducted is what differs.
## Packages Used
For conducting OLS the package used in the notebooks is the statsmodels library. While there is plenty of literature out there regarding scikit versus statsmodels, the notebooks here seek to condudct statistical inference and hypothesis testing about the model. For this, the implementation of OLS is far better throught the statsmodels library. Scikit performs better for out of sample forecasts.
