# ISEG_AEF
This repository contains code and Jupyter notebooks for my Master's program in Applied Econometrics and Data Forecasting. The program covers a range of topics in econometrics, including time series analysis, panel data analysis, and causal inference.
## Structure

The repository is organized into folders for each course in the program. Each folder contains code and Jupyter notebooks for the corresponding course. The notebooks are organized by topic and cover both theoretical concepts and practical applications.

## Courses
* [Microeconometrics](https://github.com/dhruv-pandit/ISEG_AEF/tree/main/Econometrics/Micro)
* [Macroeconometrics](https://github.com/dhruv-pandit/ISEG_AEF/tree/main/Econometrics/Macro)
* [Time Series](https://github.com/dhruv-pandit/ISEG_AEF/tree/main/Time%20Series)
* [Financial Time Series](https://github.com/dhruv-pandit/ISEG_AEF/tree/main/Financial%20Time%20Series)
* [Linear Programming and Heuristics](https://github.com/dhruv-pandit/ISEG_AEF/tree/main/Optimisation)
* [Spatial Econometrics](https://github.com/dhruv-pandit/ISEG_AEF/tree/main/Spatial%20Econometrics)

## Requirements

To run the code and notebooks in this repository, you will need to have Python 3.11 installed as well as several libraries specific to each course.

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn
```
Furthermore, for notebooks in Financial Time Series, please install R dependencies for Jupyter Notebooks.
