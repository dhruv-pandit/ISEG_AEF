# ISEG_AEF

This is my github repository for my master's program in Applied Econometrics and Data Forecasting. The folders are grouped according to courses, and I have only hosted my code and notebooks on this repository. Each course has some notebooks pertaining to either lecture notes, or python implementations of the course material. In some courses, the kernel used for the jupyter notebook is R.
