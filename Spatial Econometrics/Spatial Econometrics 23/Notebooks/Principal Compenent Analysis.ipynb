    "- Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique that transforms high-dimensions data into lower-dimensions while retaining as much information as possible.\n",
    "- - PCA is extremely useful when working with data sets that have a lot of features.\n",
    "- How?\n",
    "- The greater the variance, the more the information. Vice versa.\n",

    "> PCA is defined as an orthogonal linear transformation that transforms the data to a new coordinate system such that the greatest variance by some scalar projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate (called the first principal component), the second greatest variance on the second coordinate, and so on.\n",
    "**Variance is information.**\n"
