    "- Euclidean distance : $d_ij = \\sqrt{\\sum^p_v{(X_iv - X_jv)^2}}$\n",
    "- WSS = sum of squares within the data points \n",
    "- BSS : distance between the n clusters\n",

    "#### Nearest Neighbour\n",
    "- Max similarity between two cases belonging to groups. Given two groups, the distanec between the two is the samllest distance distance between the elements of the groups\n",

    "##### Basic Concepts  \n",
    "* **Cluster Centroid**: average of all variables for all the cases within the group ($\\bar{X}, \\bar{y}$)\n",
    "* **Initial Centres**: Starting points for non hierarchical methods\n",
    "* **Distance between cluster centres (BSS**) : dissimilarity degree of the clusters, ideally max\n",
    "* **Distance Matrix** : matrix containing distances between individuals\n",
    "* **Dendrogram**: graph that summarizes distances between individuals\n",

    "##### Steps\n",
    "1. Problem Definition\n",
    "2. Choose the variables\n",
    "3. Transform the initial data\n",
    "   1. Magnitude of the data points could be vary different\n",
    "   2. **Standardize** the variables\n",
    "   3. In a regression context, standardized coefficients and variables are important to compare the importance of the coefficients (variables)\n",
    "   4. Could opt for something like log transformations to estimate elasticities\n",
    "4. Select Clustering method\n",
    "5. Decide on number of clusters\n",
